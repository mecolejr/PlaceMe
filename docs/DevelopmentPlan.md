# Development Plan (Phased)

- Phase 0: Setup repo, DB, backend+frontend skeletons, and docs
- Phase 1: MVP data integration (safety+diversity), basic scoring, simple UI
  - Use CSV stubs initially; wire live keys later
  - Env keys required for live fetchers: `FBI_API_KEY`, `CENSUS_API_KEY`
- Phase 2: Expand data sources and refine scoring (sub-scores, breakdown)
- Phase 3: Interactive map UI and improved UX
- Phase 4: Auth, persistence, favorites, alerts groundwork
- Phase 5: Polish, launch, monitoring, roadmap

Acceptance criteria are tracked per phase in this document and in the issue log.
